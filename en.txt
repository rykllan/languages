They're still using inefficient boosters and obsolete engines. What if they could land their rockets back on Earth? Then it would be possible to send multiple payloads with only 1 rocket! I hope you can build a landing rocket or even a side booster rocket in few years.&%&%Good luck!

tutorial_BuildMode█Buildings in EarthX are very important, because without them you won't be able to do anything. To enter/exit from the build mode, use the button on the left side of the bottom bar. To build buildings, select a location and then click on the plus icon. Locations don't matter yet. &%&%There are currently 4 types of buildings available in the game: <color=#FF9F43>Office</color>, <color=#64B5F6>Factory</color>, <color=#BA68C8>Laboratory</color> and <color=#81C784>Hangar</color>. Let me now describe them to you.&%&%<color=#FF9F43>Office</color>&%Offices are looking for sattelite contracts for us. Later in the building settings you will be able to choose what kind of contracts you want to search for. Denis recommends having at least two such offices.&%&%<color=#64B5F6>Factory</color>&%The factories are responsible for the construction of rocket modules. Each factory has its own statistics, so that a factory building only fuel tanks will build them a few percent faster. &%&%<color=#BA68C8>Laboratory</color>&%Laboratories are responsible for the production of experience points. They are important because they allow you to develop new technologies faster, so you can build more efficient rockets.&%&%<color=#81C784>Hangar</color>&%The Hangars are holding your rockets. Each hangar can only store a few at a time.&%
tutorial_Rockets█Rocket management is the main activity in EarthX. From the creation of rockets, through their construction, to their launch. In the later stages of the game you will be able to land them as well, so that after a quick repair they will be able to fly again. In this tutorial you will learn all of these things.&%&%Unfortunately, due to the inability of the creator of this game ~Denis to create an interactive tutorial, you will have to make do with this wall of text, but I promise that every line will provide you with information to play this game further. On the left at the top of every window, you have a button with a question mark symbol. You can press it later in the game to show this window again.&%&%<color=#64B5F6>Creating a rocket project</color>&%To create a rocket project, click on the button at the bottom right of the rocket window. I will describe their creation another time.&%&%<color=#64B5F6>Creating a new rocket</color>&%Once you have created a project, a panel will appear in the list with the name of the rocket and its capabilities. From this panel you will be able to create rockets, which you can then manage on the right side of the window. &%&%<color=#64B5F6>Reliability and durability</color>&%Sounds dangerous? That’s okay. Every rocket built has both of these statistics. The reliability of a rocket is the average of the reliability of all modules. This number determines the percentage of chances of success of the mission. The bigger the number, the less likely the rocket will explode during the flight. The durability of disposable rockets will always be 100%, but it will decrease with each mission on reusable one.&%&%<color=#64B5F6>Repairing rockets</color>&%When the strength of reusable rockets falls below 60%, repairs will be required. Remember that a rocket is worth repairing twice at the most, then it will become uneconomic.&%
tutorial_RocketCreator█Creating different projects will give you different rockets. In this window you can set the name and modules of the project. On the right you can see all unlocked rocket modules, from which you can create different types of rockets. There are currently 6 types of rockets available in the game, of which 3 are the most important:&%<color=#64B5F6>Small/LEO</color>, <color=#64B5F6>Medium/MEO</color> and <color=#64B5F6>Large/GEO</color>. The first one determines the size of cargo a rocket can carry, and the second one determines which target orbit can be reached.&%&%Remember that having only a medium fuel tank does not mean that you will have a medium rocket. In order to have a medium sized rocket, you must also have medium sized fairings and an advanced engine.&%&%Different types of rockets will carry different payloads into space. Better rocket = better <color=#64B5F6>norminal</color> contracts. &%
tutorial_RocketBuild█You're only halfway there to the launch of your first rocket! To start building modules, you need at least one factory. You can get tired of choosing it for each module separately, but you can also use the <color=#64B5F6>norminal button</color> at the top right with the factory symbol. It will assign the available factories to each module automatically.&%&%Once the construction starts, you can sit back and wait for all the bars to fill up, but you can also <color=#64B5F6>speed up the time</color> and save yourself a few seconds of life.&%&%Once you have finished building all the modules you will be able to <color=#64B5F6>move the rocket to the hangar</color>... unless you don't have a hangar.&%
tutorial_RocketLaunch█That was easy, wasn't it? All your previous actions led to this moment... to the launch of your first rocket.&%&%You can do this by clicking on the "Launch" button, but you can also do a quick static fire.&%&%<color=#64B5F6>Static fire</color>&%This is a static test that checks whether the rocket is working or not. A rocket can sometimes explode here, but you can also find an issue just before the launch and make sure the rocket gets into orbit!&%&%Even if the rocket explodes, don't worry about it. Your first rockets have very little reliability, so they will often explode. With each explosion <color=#64B5F6>you will find one issue</color> in the rocket, which <color=#64B5F6>will be fixed</color>. After a few explosions you will have less and less issues, until you finally have <color=#64B5F6>very high reliability</color>.&%&%After your first successful flight into orbit you will receive <color=#64B5F6>a government grant</color> to have funds for your further development.&%&%Come on, show your new rocket to the whole world!&%
tutorial_Missions█Missions are a very important in EarthX. The course of the game is based on them. Thanks to them you can earn (but also lose!) money and gain experience. Missions are gained by accepting contracts, except this one mission, which is always available at any time.&%&%<color=#64B5F6>Test mission</color>&%A test mission is simply to launch a small payload (in this case concrete) to test a rocket. In case of failure of the test mission you do not pay any penalty. &%&%<color=#64B5F6>Performing a mission</color>&%In order to complete a mission, you need to select it from the list, then select the appropriate rocket and launch pad on the right. Remember that a small rocket will not carry a large payload!&%&%<color=#64B5F6>Deadlines</color>&%Each mission has its own deadline, if the mission is marked "HIGH PRIORITY", you have to complete it immediately, otherwise you will pay a penalty for being late. &%
tutorial_Contracts█By accepting contracts, you gain missions. I described the missions in another window, I hope you have already seen it. Each contract has the required percentage of trust and the missions that you will receive when you accept the contract.&%&%You gain trust through successful missions. On the right side of the window you will also see how much money you will earn (or pay) for each mission. Always keep an eye on what mission you are on. Don't take a medium mission unless you have a medium rocket.&%
tutorial_Research█You have just opened the most important window in this game. This is where you can unlock new technologies and upgrade your existing ones.&%&%You can now unlock the first 4 modules: <color=#64B5F6>Small fairings</color>, <color=#64B5F6>Small fuel tank</color>, <color=#64B5F6>Simple engine</color> and <color=#64B5F6>Simple computer</color>! These are the modules from which you will be able to design and build your first rocket.&%&%When you unlock a module, you will notice that the next ones will become visible. You will be able to unlock them for the appropriate amount of skill points and level of your company.&%&%You can upgrade each module separately. They will then build faster, cost less and be more reliable. The speed and cost of construction will decrease over time, but with upgrades it will be much faster.&%&%<color=#64B5F6>How to earn special experience points?</color>&%Upgrades require so-called "special skill points". These are points for only 3 types of modules: <color=#64B5F6>Fairings</color>, <color=#64B5F6>Fuel tanks</color> and <color=#64B5F6>Engines</color>. You can view their status at any time under the bottom bar.&%&%You can get them by building these types of modules. For example, if you build an engine, you will get 1 to 3 such points.&%
tutorial_Buildings█Building management is crucial in this game. With them you can speed up or slow down your work. Let's assume for a moment that you prefer to speed it up.&%&%<color=#64B5F6>Naming buildings</color>&%The first thing you can do is to name the buildings properly. It is worthwhile to name factories by the module types, because then one factory will be able to build only engines, and after some time it will do it much faster. Naming buildings will allow you to organize your work more efficiently.&%&%<color=#64B5F6>Employees</color>&%The second important thing are the employees.
