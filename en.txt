welcome_notification█Hello, <color=#64B5F6>{0}</color>!&%I see you've finally set up the rocket company you've mentioned before. "<color=#64B5F6>{1}</color>" is actually a cool name! I have to tell you, you're very brave.&%&%Big companies that have a monopoly on the launch provider market have not invested in newer technology for years. They're still using inefficient boosters and obsolete engines. What if they could land their rockets back on Earth? Then it would be possible to send even a few payloads with only 1 rocket! I hope you can build a landing rocket or even a side booster rocket in few years.&%&%Good luck!

fail5█Short circuit×Uninsulated cables touched and caused a short circuit, destroying the entire installation.
fail6█Battery failure×Overheating of the battery caused the systems necessary to maintain the rocket's flight to shut down.
fail7█Windows update×The system update started automatically and caused the rocket modules to shut down. (xD)
fail8█Sensor failure×One of the sensors did not work properly and transmitted the wrong information to the rocket computer.
fail9█Connection failure×The rocket couldn't get the necessary information from the flight control centre.
fail10█Antenna failure×The probable failure of the antenna caused the computer not to receive the necessary information from the flight control centre.
fail11█Overpressure×In the combustion chamber there was too high a pressure, which was the reason for the explosion of the engine.
fail12█Leakage×One of the employees forgot about the gaskets.
fail13█Blocked pipe×One of the employees left his work tool in a pipe.
fail14█Material fatigue×The material of which the module was made did not withstand its operation.
fail15█Fuel leakage×A small hole caused a gradual leak of fuel, which ignited and exploded the rocket.
fail16█Hydraulic system failure×The hooks couldn't get off the hook. 
fail17█Pressure×The pressure was too high, which ruptured the payload and then the rocket.
fail18█Move engines failure×The engines didn't work and the fairings hit the rocket.
fail19█Lockout failure×The fairings couldn't open, the engines inside turned on and ruptured the rocket.
fail20█The fuel was too cool×The cool fuel caused it to freeze and then suddenly unfreeze.
fail21█Compression×The fuel was compressed too much, which caused the rocket to rupture.
fail22█The fuel was too hot×The hot fuel created gases inside the fuel tank that exploded when ignited. 
fail23█Unknown reason×The analysts didn't find any reason for the explosion. It was probably the weather conditions.
