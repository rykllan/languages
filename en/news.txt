news_technology_content_p21█{1}: "The rockets we are currently developing are far from competitive. Let's hope it's not just a simple boast to make more profits on the stock market. Does {0} really have better technologies? Will we ever set foot on Mars? 
news_technology_content_p22█"We hope to look to the future. Improvements of our rockets will not only allow us to carry larger charges into orbit. This is the beginning of the path that mankind will follow over the next decades. - {1}, {0}. 
news_technology_content_p23█The new generation engine presented by %company name% has just passed its first successful tests last year. {1} announced that within 10 years the engine will be on the board of one of the rockets to test it in the vacuum of space.

news_technology_content_p24█"I'm sure it'll work!", says {1} at yesterday's conference. He wants to recover the rockets that fell to the Earth after the launch of the payload into orbit.

news_fail_content_p14█Another day, another unpleasant news from the camp {0}. A rocket that belongs to a billionaire named {1} ended its mission in a rather unexpected and loud way.

The company's CEO, {1}, commented on the situation in a short Twitter post: "The one who does nothing makes no mistakes. Cheers!".

news_fail_content_p22█Our anonymous source, closely associated with the company, informs that in 3 minutes from the launch of the rocket there was a failure of hydraulics in the combustion chamber of the engine. Details will probably be announced at the press conference planned for today. 
news_fail_content_p23█The causes of the accident are not yet well identified and will be investigated in detail in the coming months. Regardless of the cause, the explosion means a major image loss for {0}. 
news_fail_content_p24█The whole team is working hard to explain the reasons for the explosion. We will soon find out whether the equipment failed, whether it was a human failure or whether it was an act of unfair competition.
news_fail_content_p25█The bitterness of the situation is not hidden by the fans of the company all over the world, for whom {1} from the beginning of its activity was the embodiment of innovation and ideal entrepreneur. "I am sick and tired and I am selling all my shares now! I want to see beautiful flights, not explosions..." - was written by @denis-szwarc, the user of reddit.com.

news_bankrupt_content_p12█Problems with exploding rockets, failure to comply with contracts and mess in financial documents are probably not the only mistakes of the chairman of {0}. {1} today declared bankruptcy.
news_bankrupt_content_p13█We will probably wait a long time for the first successful crew mission to Mars. The market does not forgive the mistakes made by {1}, the owner of {0}. The company was closed today.

news_bankrupt_content_p21█This sad end of the dreams about conquering space is only the beginning of {0} financial problems. According to the information we have received, the company is flooded with lawsuits for property damage. All because of the rocket parts falling on private homes.
news_bankrupt_content_p22█The emotional statement that {1} sent to the media does not lack bitter words towards the other members of the management board. "My dreams were stolen (...) by traitors and thieves. I did everything in my power and now I am left with nothing. I'm sorry."
news_bankrupt_content_p23█The press conference of {0} was a dramatic one. {1} appeared on it with a black eye. As he explained, there was a small fight with another member of the management board.

news_FundraisingHats_header█{1} has sold 20,000 hats with the {0} logo. The perfect way to finance space business?
news_FundraisingHats_content█{1} is amazing. Crazy, but still amazing. {0}'s CEO was told by the management to add some cash to the company's budget in the sharpest possible way.
